A program is needed for Black Cabs Transport Company, to calculate the total amount a particular 
customer should pay for a given trip. The services provided by the cab service company are listed 
below.

Package No    Package Name

   1            Comfort Journey
   2            Budget cab Journey
   3            Crowded Journey – Dual A/C
   4            Crowded Journey – Single A/C

For comfort Journey package, Rs.150.00 is charged for the first kilometer and for each additional 
kilometer, Rs.175.00 will be charged. For a Budget cab Journey package each kilometer is 
charged at Rs. 100.00. For a Crowded Journey – Dual A/C package the first kilometer is charged 
at Rs. 130.00 and each remaining kilometer is charged at Rs.150.00. If the customer selected 
Crowded Journey – Single A/C package, the first kilometer is charged at Rs120.00 and for each 
remaining kilometer is charged at Rs. 130.00.

(a) Write a C program to input the package no and total distance of the tour in Kilometers
through the keyboard. The program should display corresponding total amount that the 
customer has to pay. (Hint: use nested selection statements.)

Ex: Package No: 2
     Total Distance: 5 Km
     Total Amount: Rs. 500

(b) Modify your program to display an error message “Invalid Package Number” if the user 
inputs a wrong package number.

(c) Modify the program to handle many customers. After displaying the total amount to pay 
by the first customer, your program should display the prompt “Do you have more 
customers?” If the user inputs “y” or “Y”, program should ask for the package no and 
total distance of the next customer. If the user inputs “n” or “N” program should terminate.
